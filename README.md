# ü•ó Tracalorie JS Project

A lightweight calorie tracking web application built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, following the **Module Controller Pattern** and using **IIFEs** for encapsulation and separation of concerns. It allows users to track meals and their calorie intake with persistent data storage using `localStorage`.

---

## üìå Project Purpose

This project was built to:

- Practice **modular programming** with JavaScript.
- Implement **IIFE-based module patterns** to organize code into logical units (UI Controller, Storage Controller, App Controller, etc.).
- Understand **state management** without frameworks.
- Store and manage data using the **browser's localStorage API**.
- Build a responsive and interactive UI with **vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS**.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Add meals and their calorie counts  
- ‚úÖ Edit existing meals  
- ‚úÖ Delete individual meals  
- ‚úÖ View total calories consumed  
- ‚úÖ Clear all meals at once  
- ‚úÖ Persist data using `localStorage`  
- ‚úÖ Fully modular code using **IIFE + Controller pattern**

## üß† Tech Highlights

### ‚úÖ Module Controller Pattern

The project is broken into 4 key modules, all implemented using IIFE:

1. **Storage Controller**:  
   - Handles all `localStorage` interactions  
   - Persists, retrieves, updates, and deletes data

2. **Item Controller**:  
   - Manages app state and data model  
   - Handles logic for adding, updating, deleting items

3. **UI Controller**:  
   - Manages DOM manipulation  
   - Updates HTML based on app state

4. **App Controller**:  
   - Initializes the app  
   - Sets up event listeners  
   - Acts as the central communication point between all modules

Each module is **encapsulated** using an IIFE, exposing only necessary methods (public API) and keeping internal functions private.

## üíæ LocalStorage Integration

- Every meal item is stored in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `meals`.
- Modifying or clearing data automatically reflects in localStorage.
- No backend or database needed.
